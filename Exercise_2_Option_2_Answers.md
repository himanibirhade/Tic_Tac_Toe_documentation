# Instructions to Play Tic-Tac-Toe

## Overview

Tic-Tac-Toe or Noughts and Crosses, is a simple and classic two-player game played on a `3x3` grid. Players take turns placing their allotted symbol (`X` or `O`) on the grid's empty spaces. The goal is to form a line of three of your symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. 

## Purpose

The goal is to place your symbol (`X` or `O`) on a `3x3` grid to form a straight line of three to test your ability to outwit your opponent in a race to victory. The straight line can run horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

## Game Rules

The following are the rules for playing the Tic-Tac-Toe game. 

1. The traditional version of Tic-Tac-Toe is played on a `3×3` grid that incorporates nine squares.
2. Players must select their symbol (either `X` or `O`) before the game starts and must play the entire game using the selected symbol.
3. Players must take turns and can only make one mark with each turn.
4. Marks can only be placed in empty squares. Once the mark is placed, its position remains unchanged.
5. The first player to get three of their marks in a straight line, which can run horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, wins the game.
6. The game ends when all nine squares are filled with marks, even if no player has a straight line of three marks.
7. If no player has a straight line of three marks, then it is considered a draw.

## Game Play

### Prerequisites

Ensure that the following prerequisites are met before you begin the game:

- Draw a grid of `3x3` squares.
- Decide who will use `X` and who will use `O`. 
- Determine the first player. To decide who goes first, you can flip a coin, play rock-paper-scissors, or use any agreed-upon method.

### Start the Game

The following are the steps to play the Tic-Tac-Toe game.

1. Player 1, who goes first, places their symbol (either `X` or `O`) in any empty cell on the grid.
> If you are going first, then the best move you can make is to place your symbol in the center. It maximizes your chances of winning and allows you to create a straight line of three in more combinations.
2. Player 2 goes next and places a different symbol from the first player in a blank spot on the grid.
> The second player can try to block the first player from creating a straight line of three or can try to win by focusing on making their own straight line of three.
3. Keep alternating moves until a player wins or the game ends in a draw.
4. After the game ends, the players can choose to start a new game by resetting the grid and taking turns again.

### How to Win

A player wins the game by having three of their symbols in a straight line (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally). The game is won when:
- Three marks are placed in the same row.
- Three marks are placed in the same column.
- Three marks are placed diagonally from the top left to the bottom right.
- Three marks are placed diagonally from the top right to the bottom left.

### End the Game

The game ends when:
- A player wins by having three marks in a straight line, which can run horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
- The grid is filled even if no player has a straight line of three marks.
